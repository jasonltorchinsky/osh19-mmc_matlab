The purpose of this code is to create an implementation of a multi-model ensemble of the Ogrosky--Stechman--Hottovy 2019 and Chen--Mjada--Giannakis 2014 systems, given in \cite{Ogrosky19} and \cite{Chen14}, respectively. 

We begin by introducing both systems in the form we discretize in our simulation in Subsections~\ref{subsection:osh19} and \ref{subsection:cmg14}, respectively.
