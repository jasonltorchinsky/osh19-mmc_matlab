# `docs`

This is the directory containing additional documentation for the simulation, including acknowledgements and references. This directory cotains the necessary `.tex`, `.sty`, and `.bib` files to create this additional documentation, with `main.tex` as the primary LaTeX file. The pre-built documentation is included in the `build` subdirectory, although it may not be entirely up-to-date with the current build of the code. As is usual with projects involving software development, the progress of the code tends to outpace the writing of its documentation.
