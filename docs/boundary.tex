We utilize rigid-lid boundary conditions at the model top ($z = H$) and surface ($z = 0$). In patricular, at these altitudes we have $w = \theta = q = 0$, $p = 0$ at the model top, and $u = v = 0$ at the model surface.

In the zonal and meridional directions, we utilize periodic boundary conditions. As noted in \cite{Ogrosky19}, although periodic boundary conditions on the meridional direction are unrealistic, the channel width is sufficiently large such that these boundaries do not greatly affect the dynamics in the tropics.
